A smart, fast, simple, and reliable keyword completion replacement for Vim.

It differs from the standard keyword completion by extensive usage of distance and frequency algorithms in order to perform keyword matching. Those algorithms are inspired by TextMate's keyword completion experiences.

It is written with K to emphasize its new approach to keyword completion.
